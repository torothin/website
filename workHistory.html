            <p class="lead">B/E Aerospace (2015-2016)</p>
            
            <p class="p-narrow">I joined B/E Aerospace - ALCI as a Materials and Process Engineer. I was part of Materials team which maintained process specifications for manufacturing, testing, and fire properties. I wrote several test plans for new polymers, polymer suppliers and manufacture’s. Every test plan and specification was thoroughly checked by our customers (Boeing) to ensure quality of the product.

            </p>
            
            <p class="p-narrow">I moved to the new Sustain team where I helped to ensure that repairs and maintenance was performed on products delivered to Boeing's customers. While in the sustain team I performed routine tasks such as approving designs to ensure they meet process specifications, checking repair methods and processes, and checking designs to ensure they meet FAA fire safety requirements.

            <p class="lead">Exotic Metals (2011-2015)</p>
            
            <p class="p-narrow">While working at Exotic Metals forming company, I was part of a brand new R&D group as a Research Engineer, charged to bring the company’s manufacturing capability up to date and on into the future. Projects such as 3D metal printing, testing new Titanium and Nickel Alloys, and new forming technologies and manufacturing technologies are just examples of projects I was involved in while in the R&D team.

            </p>

            <p class="p-narrow">Projects I directly participated in include Hybrid plastic/titanium structures, High Temperature Forming, forming measuring techniques, and GTAW improvement studies. While in the R&D team I developed engineering skills such as Project Management, specification writing, drawing interpretation, and 3D modeling. I became an expert in Titanium and Nickel Alloys, being the first point of contact for suppliers wanting to introduce a new alloy.

            </p>

            <p class="lead">Modumetal, Inc. (2010-2011)</p>

            <p class="p-narrow">As an intern at Modumetal, I used the research skills I developed while at college. I worked for a Project Engineer helping his team to generate and analyze data through mechanical testing of iron nickel nano-laminates.  We also tested for corrosion resistance using salt spray tanks and measured deposition coverage and thickness. One of my projects was to develop a guide for placement of electrodes in a deposition tank to obtain uniform thickness laminate deposits. I modeled various electrode configurations using Comsol software creating visualization of current paths through the electrolytic baths used in the lamination process.

            </p>

            <p class="lead">US Navy (2000-2006)</p>
            
            <p class="p-narrow">I enlisted in the US Navy in 2000 as a Nuclear Mechanic, working in the engine room for a nuclear aircraft carrier. Every "nuke" (Nuclear Technician) went through a rigorous training program where we learned Thermodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Marine Engineering. I was then sent to the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), serving a sea tour for four and a half years. The Abraham Lincoln was part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake relief effort in Sumatra. I completed my six year enlistment in 2006 with an Honorable Discharge.
