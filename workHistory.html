            <p class="lead">B/E Aerospace</p>
            
            <p class="p-narrow">I joined B/E Aerospace - ALCI as a Materials and Process Engineer. I was part of a team which maintained
              process specifications for manufacturing, testing, and fire properties. I wrote several test plans for
              new polymers, polymer suppliers and manufactures. Every test plan and specification was throughly checked
              by our customers (Boeing) to ensure quality of the product.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p-narrow">I moved to the new Sustain team where I helped to ensure repairs and maintenance was performed on products
              delivered to Boeing's customers. While in the sustain team I performed routine tasks such as approving
              designs (drawings) to ensure they meet process specifications, checking repair methods and process, and 
              checking designs to ensure they meet FAA fire safety requirements.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="lead">Exotic Metals</p>
            
            <p class="p-narrow">While working at Exotic Metals forming company, I was part of a brand new R&D group as a Research Engineer,
              charged to bring the companies manufacturing capability up to date and on into the future. Projects such as
              3D metal printing, testing new Titanium and Nickel Alloys, and new forming technologies and manufacturing
              technologies are just examples of projects the R&D team was involved in.
            </p>

            <p class="p-narrow">Projects I directly participated in include Hybrid Waste Tubes, High Temperature Forming, and forming measuring
              techniques. While in the R&D team I developed engineering skills such as Project Management, specification writing,
              drawing interpretation, and 3D modeling. I became an expert in Titanium and Nickel Alloys, being the first point of
              contact for suppliers wanting to introduce a new alloy.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">Modumetal, Inc.</p>

            <p class="p-narrow">As an intern working at Modumetal, I put to use some of the research skills I developed while going to college. I
              worked for a Project Engineer helping his team to test iron nickel nano laminates for corrosion resistance, strength
              and deposition coverage. One of my projects was to develop a guide for placement of electrodes in a deposition tank
              to obtain uniform thickness laminate deposits. Comsol software was utilized for visualization of current paths through
              the electrolytic baths used in the lamination process.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">US Navy</p>
            
            <p class="p-narrow">I enlisted in the US Navy in 2000 as a Nuclear Mechanic, working in the engine room for a nuclear aircraft carrier.
              Ever "nuke" (Nuclear Technician) went through a rigorous training program where we learned Thermodynamics, Nuclear
              Physics and Marine Engineering. I was then sent to the USS Abraham Lincoln, serving for four and a half years. The
              Abraham Lincoln was part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake
              relief effort in Sumatra. I completed my six year enlistment in 2006 with an Honorable Discharge.
