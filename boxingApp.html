            <p class="p-narrow">An idea came to me in my Muay Thai class one day.  What if I had an app that called out random combinations for me on a timer.  I thought to myself, “I can build that”.  Initially, the app was going to be for mobile devices.  I had tinkered around with swift in the past, so I started to think iOS first then maybe android.  I realized that I needed to be sure that I wasn’t the only one that might use something like this because jumping straight to mobile might be a bigger leap than necessary.  I looked at JavaScript and realized I could build it using JavaScript.</p>
            <p class="p-narrow">I implementing some feedback I received from classmates and the head instructor for my class.  The experience was very useful in learning front end development because every browser handles the web app a little differently.  I plan to implement several features and then rebuild it for mobile devices.</p>
