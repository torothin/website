        <p class="lead">UW Bothell</p>
        
        <p>I obtained a <b>Graduate Certificate in Software Design & Development</b>, in 2018, where I learned
          software development in C++. During my time in this program I learned about object-oriented programming,
          data structures and algorithms. I also learn about various project management styles such as Waterfall,
          Kanban, and Agile software development.</p>

        <p>more about projects and meeting "customer" expectations.</p>

        <p>Prior to attending UW Bothell, I began my programming journey by taking online </p>

        <p class="lead">UW Seattle</p>
        
        <p>After transferring to UW Seattle, I earned a <b>BS in Material Science and Engineering</b> in 2011. While at UW, I learned about 
          metal alloys, polymers and composite systems. I took courses in material testing to gain insights into the strengths and weakness 
          of various materials and their applications. I also learned how to do research and and write research papers. My undergrad research
          capstone was the development of a Copper Nickel Electrodeposition method. The method was used by a MSE Graduate to study 
          nano-laminate material properties.

        <p>After leaving the Navy, I started my education at North Seattle Community College. I earned an <b>Associate of Science</b>, in 2009,
          as part of the transfer requirements. My class load included Physics, Chemistry, Calculus and Thermodynamics.
