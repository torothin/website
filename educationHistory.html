        <p class="lead">UW Bothell (2017-2018)</p>
        
        <p>I obtained a <b>Graduate Certificate in Software Design & Development</b>, in 2018, where I learned software development in C++. During my time in this program I learned about object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms. I also learn about various project management styles such as Waterfall, Kanban, and Agile software development.  While in this program I completed 12 projects on-time and per specification.  
          </p>

        <p>Prior to attending UW Bothell, I began my programming journey by taking online courses.  I took courses on Udemy, EDX.org and Coursera.  These courses helped prepare me for entrance into the Graduate Certificate program.

        <p>After transferring to UW Seattle, I earned a <b>BS in Material Science and Engineering</b> in 2011. While at UW, I learned about metal alloys, polymers and composite systems. I took courses in material testing to gain insights into the strengths and weakness of various materials and their applications. I also learned how to research academic topics and and write research papers. My undergrad research capstone was the development of a Copper Nickel Electrodeposition method using nano-laminate technology. The method was used by a MSE Graduate to study nano-laminate material properties.
