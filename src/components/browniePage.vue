            <p>One thing I have always struggled with is to complete all the goals I've had at any point and to complete them regularly.  I seen and used several apps that take advantage of the psychological affects of gaining levels, experience and rewards for completing things like walking 10,000 steps or eating under a specified calorie count, etc.  I thought to myself, I could do something like this for completing any goals I want to create.</p>
            <p>I created to Brownie Points app in hopes of creating good long term habits through a reward system.  I have been learning javascript because of the power and accessibility of web apps on browsers.  This app utilizes Bootstrap 3 and pure javascript while saving all user data in local storage.</p>
            <p>For the future, I would like to complete all the features desired and to use AWS to save user data in a more long term and safer way.</p>
