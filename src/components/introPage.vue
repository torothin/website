            <p>Thanks to my wife, I had the opportunity to make a career change from being a Materials and Process Engineer to a Software Developer. I have spent the last two years learning programming fundamentals and software development.  I have been enjoying the experience and I look forward to starting my new career as soon as possible.</p>
